# Sub Waypoints: Exploratory Analysis of Subway Traffic
## Metis Project 1

In this project, I cleaned, explored, analyzed, and visualized NYC subway turnstile data from the MTA in order to determine the flow of commuters using the NYC subway system. The goal of this exploration is to recommend subway station locations to maximize the effectiveness of street canvassers for a non-profit.
